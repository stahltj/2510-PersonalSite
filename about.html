    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class="aboutMe">
      Outside of my working life, sometings I enjoy that are the aformentioned
      photography, cars, legos, and video games.

      <h3>Photography</h3>

      <p>
        As stated before, I have been doing photography since high school and it
        has been a constant in my life since. I love taking pictures of
        landscapes, macro subjects, and I love photographing candid moments.

      <h3>Cars</h3>
      <img class="aboute30" src="IMG_0858.jpg" />
      <p>
        My love of automobiles came around when my best friend in high school
        bought a 2018 Toyota Corolla, and I thought was the coolest car to
        exist. Since then I have been down a rabbit hole and now own my very own
        1988 BMW 325is that I spend money, time, and effort into keeping
        running. While it is one of my most favorite cars ever designed, I do
        have a love/hate relationship with it- I love to work on it, hate to
        break it. However, it gives me experiences I cannot replace.

      <h3>Legos</h3>

      <p>
        I have been building legos since I was a young child, some of my
        favorite memories are with Legos and the varioius sets that have been
        out on the market. My favorite right now is the new Keith Harring set. I
        love Keith Harring's work and have a tattoo of one of his pieces.

      <h3>Video Games</h3>

      <p>
        Video games are a big part of my life, while I don't spend every waking
        hour playing them, I have wonderful memories with them. Whether its
        playing with friends late at night or a casual playthrough of my
        favorites, and as cheesey as it may be, I will always have time to for a
        game.
