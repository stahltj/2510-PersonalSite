      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="blurb">
        Outside of my working life, sometings I enjoy that are the aformentioned
        photography, cars, legos, and video games.

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <img src="IMG_9696.jpg" />
        <p>
          As stated before, I have been doing photography since high school and
          it has been a constant in my life since. I love taking pictures of
          landscapes, macro subjects, and I love photographing candid moments.

        <h3>Cars</h3>
        <img src="IMG_0858.jpg" />
        <p>
          My love of automobiles came around when my best friend in high school
          bought a 2018 Toyota Corolla, and I thought was the coolest car to
          exist. Since then I have been down a rabbit hole and now own my very
          own 1988 BMW 325is that I spend money, time, and effort into keeping
          running. While it is one of my most favorite cars ever designed, I do
          have a love/hate relationship with it- I love to work on it, hate to
          break it. However, it gives me experiences I cannot replace.

        <h3>Legos</h3>

        <p>
          I have been building legos since I was a young child, some of my
          favorite memories are with Legos and the varioius sets that have been
          out on the market. My favorite right now is the new Keith Harring set.
          I love Keith Harring's work and have a tattoo of one of his pieces.

        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <img src="IMG_7821.jpg" />
        <p>
          Video games are a big part of my life, while I don't spend every
          waking hour playing them, I have wonderful memories with them. Whether
          its playing with friends late at night or a casual playthrough of my
          favorites, and as cheesey as it may be, I will always have time to for
          a game.
