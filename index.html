       Hello, I am Tyler Stahl, I was born in 2002 in Pheonix, Arizona and my family moved up to Denver, Colorado when I was four years old. Some of my hobbies include photography, cars, legos, and videogames.
       I have been doing photography since high school and was taught how to do so by my father; It is a great creative outlet and a wonderful way for me to express my love of automobiles and the people around me.
       I am currently learning how to code websites in order to change my career path. It is something I really do enjoy and hope to make a successful career out of.
